          When you visit or interact with our sites, services, applications,
          tools or messaging, we or our authorized service providers may use
          cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies for storing
          information to help provide you with a better, faster, and safer

          This page is designed to help you understand more about these
          technologies and our use of them on our sites and in our services,
          applications, and tools. Below is a summary of a few key things you
          should know about our use of such technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our cookies and similar technologies have different functions. They
          are either necessary for the functioning of our services, help us
          improve our performance, give you extra functionalities, or help us to
          serve you relevant and targeted ads. We use cookies and similar
          technologies that only remain on your device for as long as you keep
          your browser active (session) and cookies and similar technologies
          that remain on your device for a longer period (persistent). You are
          free to block, delete, or disable these technologies if your device
          permits so. You can manage your cookies and your cookie preferences in
          your browser or device settings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where possible, security measures are set in place to prevent
          unauthorized access to our cookies and similar technologies. A unique
          identifier ensures that only we and/or our authorized service
          providers have access to cookie data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Service providers are companies that help us with various aspects of
          our business, such as site operations, services, applications,
          advertisements and tools. We use some authorized service providers to
          help us to serve you relevant ads on our services and other places on
          the internet. These service providers may also place cookies on your
          device via our services (third party cookies). They may also collect
          information that helps them identify your device, such as IP-address
          or other unique or device identifiers.

          What are cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies?
        </p>
        <p>
          Like most sites, we use technologies that are essentially small data
          files placed on your computer, tablet, mobile phone, or other devices
          (referred to collectively as a "device") that allow us to record
          certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with our
          sites, services, applications, messaging, and tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          The specific names and types of the cookies, web beacons, unique
          identifiers, and similar technologies we use to collect information
          (e.g. about the pages you view, the links you click, and other actions
          you take on our Services, within our advertising or e-mail content)
          may change from time to time. In order to help you better understand
          this Policy and our use of such technologies we have provided the
          following limited terminology and definitions:

            Cookies - Small text files (typically made up of letters and
            numbers) placed in the memory of your browser or device when you
            visit a website or view a message. Cookies allow a website to
            recognize a particular device or browser. There are several types of
            cookies:

              Persistent cookies are stored on your device in between browser

            such as flash cookies, HTML 5 cookies, and other web application
            software methods. These technologies can operate across all of your
            browsers, and in some instances may not be fully managed by your
            browser and may require management directly through your installed
