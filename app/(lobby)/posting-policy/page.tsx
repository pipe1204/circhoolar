        <p className="font-semibold">Updated December 2023</p>
        <p>
          As a condition of use of Circhoolar, and as part of agreeing to our
          Terms of Use you agree to comply with these policies.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Circhoolar, we want to make sure that the site is as clean,
          friendly, and usable as possible for everyone. Ads that fall outside
          the posting rules in this policy may be removed from the site in
          accordance with our Terms of Use.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are solely responsible for all information that you submit to
          Circhoolar and any consequences that may result from your post. We
          reserve the right at our discretion to refuse or delete content that
          we believe is inappropriate, or breaches our Terms of Use or breaches
          legislation. We also reserve the right at our discretion to restrict a
          user's use of the site either temporarily or permanently, or refuse a
          user's registration or cancel a user’s account. See our Terms of Use
          for more information on how you may and may not use the Platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          If an ad fails to meet any of the criteria, or for any of the reasons
          set out below, Circhoolar may remove your ad in accordance with our
          Terms of Use – with or without notice to you.
        </p>

          General reasons for ads being deleted are:

        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mx-10">
          <li className="mb-2">
            Your ad includes information which Circhoolar believes is designed
            to manipulate search, including keyword stuffing and adding tags to
            your ad.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2">
            The ad is a duplicate of another ad previously posted.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2">
            The ad is posted under the wrong category, or your ad cannot be
            allocated into a category we provide (you must choose the single
            most relevant category for your ad).
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2">
            Ads posted in a language other than English. We only accept ads in
            English. It's acceptable to include a translation of your ad in
            another language in addition to English.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2">
            Ads posted from overseas or from behind a VPN unless the ad is
            posted in anticipation of you being in Australia (eg. to find a
            place to live or a job while you are here). Circhoolar is for
            Australian based individuals and businesses only.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2">
            Ad contains external links: No external website links are allowed
            within your ad to other property / job / classified or auction
            sites.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2">
            Not descriptive enough: Ads that do not provide enough detail will
            be placed on hold or removed as this makes for a bad browsing
            experience.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2">
            Ads which do not meet the Children’s Advertising Code as adopted by
            the Australian Association of National Advertisers, which includes
            not advertising sex related services and displaying proper safety
            standards.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2">
            Ad contains inappropriate language, including any language which
            contravenes the Australian Association of National Advertisers Code
            of Conduct.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2">
            Ads that contain any inappropriate photo or image, including any
            images which contravene the Australian Association of National
            Advertisers Code of Conduct.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2">
            Discriminatory on race / religion / nationality / gender / sexual
            orientation / political views etc.
          </li>

            Ads that report other fraudulent ads. Please report potentially
            fraudulent ads via the "report ad" option located within each ad or
            Contact Us with ad details (ad id, email address) and reasons why
            these ads should be reviewed.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2">
            Ads that are intended to profit off natural disasters, health or
            public safety concerns (including epidemics or pandemics or related
            government restrictions), or tragic events.
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2">
            Ads that contain misinformation, including but not limited to the
            misinformation of health related information.

            Ads relating to the exploitation or potential endangerment of
            minors. Circhoolar reserves the right to remove any ad that we
            determine is in breach of, or may breach, our policies or
            legislation, is not relevant or in the correct category, or is not
            of value to the Circhoolar community, with or without notice to the

          There are several ways that your ad may be found to be in breach of
          policy and removed from the site including:
        </p>
        <p className="font-semibold">Your ad has been reported to us</p>
        <p>
          When this happens your ad may be temporarily suspended until we review
          it. We check reported ads as quickly as we can. If we conclude that
          the ad hasn't broken any Posting Policies or Terms of Use we will
          activate the ad again promptly. Check back after a few hours to see if
          this is the case.

          Your ad has been removed by our moderation tools

          Ads identified by our automated tools that break our Posting Policies
          or Terms of Use will be removed from the site.
        </p>
        <p>
          In most cases we email you to let you know when we have had to remove
          your ad. These emails sometimes get directed to junk folders so please
          look out for Circhoolar emails. You may wish to add Circhoolar to your
          safe senders list if you have one.

          If you have checked out all of these possibilities and none of them
          apply to your ad then please let us know by clicking on "Contact

          you out.
