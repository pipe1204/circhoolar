        <p className="font-semibold">Social login</p>
        <p>When you use social login:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mx-10">
          <li className="mb-2">
            If you sign into your social network account using the same email
            that you previously used to register for an account with us, you
            will access your existing account with us
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2">
            If you sign into your social network account using an email address
            that we donâ€™t recognise in our systems, a new account will be
            created in our systems for you
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You may use social login or regular sign in each time you login into
          your account with us. If you use regular sign in but a password has
          not been issued to you (because you registered through social login)
          you need to get a password through the password reset flow.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you use social login the 'keep me signed in' policies of the
          social network provider apply. We do not control those policies. For
          your safety we recommend that you:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mx-10">
          <li className="mb-2">
            Donâ€™t use social login if you are accessing our Services using a
            public or shared device
          </li>
          <li className="mb-2">
            Visit your social network provider site to learn about their sign in
            policies and your options

          <span className="font-semibold">Unwanted or threatening email</span>{" "}
          We do not tolerate abuse of our Services. You do not have permission
          to add other users to your mailing list, call or send SMS messages for
          commercial purposes, even if a user bought something from you, unless
          the user has given their explicit consent. Sending unwanted or
          threatening email and SMS messages is against our Terms of Use. To
          report spam or spoof emails please contact Customer Service.
